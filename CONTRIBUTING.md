If you notice a bug or want to propose an improvement we'd love to see your PRs! Here's a couple of housekeeping rules to keep in mind while proposing your contribution.

# How to contribute
Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and make sure you follow [Contributing Developer Certificate of Origin](CONTRIBUTING_DEVELOPER_CERTIFICATE_OF_ORIGIN.txt). 

If you're thinking of adding a big new feature, consider opening an
issue first to discuss it to ensure it aligns to the direction of the
project (and potentially save yourself some time!).
