     Entry point to deserialize from validation json data
     
     This method called after validation has completed successfully.
     Raw JSON data has been unwrapped from `JSONValue` and you can safely force-cast it expected type.
     You are expected to construct your model object from validated json data.
     
     - Note: keys in the json dictionary has been replaced with values of `PropertyName` that you implementation provided.
     - Note: values are only unwrapped at first level of nestness, which means `JSONValue` containing array or object and unwrapped recursively.
     
     - Parameters:
     - json: validated and unwrapped json data; keys replaced with `PropertyName`, values and primitive types
     
     - Returns desereialized model object.
     
     - Throws: deserizliation of nested objects may follow it's own schema validatio, that in turn can throw.
